# This config file should live in the same directory as shotgun_io.py. 
# Alternately, it can live at /etc/shotgun_io.conf. shotgun_io.py will
# look for shotgun_io.conf first in the same directory, then in /etc/.
# If you need to change this, you will have to modify the variable
# shotgun_io_conf_path at the top of the shotgun_io.py script.

# VERSION FIELDS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
[version_fields]
# Field mapping for data to Version entity fields
# 
# Define what field each piece of information will be stored in inside
# of Shotgun. Each option shows the default value in the comment preceding
# the setting. Some of these data items already have a default field on the 
# Version entity for storing the info. Others do not and would require you
# set them manually and optionally create new fields to store them.
#
# If you don't want to store a particular piece of information, simply comment
# it out or set it to an empty string ('').
# 
# The Shotgun fields specified below must be valid data types.  We list the 
# valid types in the comments preceding each entry.
# 
# 
# The Version name provided by the Artist in the submit dialog. 
# (Example: demo_100_010_anim_v1)
# Valid data types: text
# ** REQUIRED **
# name: code
name: code

# Entity the submitted Version is for and will be linked to in Shotgun.
# Valid data types: entity (Shot,Asset)
# ** REQUIRED **
# shot: entity
shot: entity

# Status of the render job. The status will be translated and updated
# in Shotgun on the Version entity. See the 'version_status' section below.
# Valid data types: status_list, list, text
# job_status: sg_status_list
job_status: sg_status_list

# Full path to the location of rendered frames in sequence notation (ie.

# Frame range specified in the render job. This can be a simple format (eg. 1-100)
# a complex format (eg. 1-100,2) or a mixture of formats separated by a single
# space (eg. 1-100,2 200 300 351-400)

# Field mapping for data to Version entity fields
# Comma-separated Version name templates to present to the Artist in the

# by default. If you don't want to specify a default, Insert a comma at the 
# beginning of the list (eg. , ${project}_${shot}_${task}_v, ...)
# 
# You can use the following tokens for automatic 
# string replacement where available:
#   ${project} - The name of the Project the Version is linked to
#   ${shot} - The display name of the Shot or Asset the Version is for
#   ${task} - The name of the Task linked to the Version
#   ${user} - login of the user creating the Version
#   ${jobid} - the job id of the render job
#   (unimplemented) # - Version number. Automatically computed by shotgun_io based on configuration
#       *Must be last item on the string to work*

#    MyProject_100_010_anim_v1
#    MyProject_100_010_layout_v2
#    ...
# 'global' will increment Version #s independent of Task so there will only be
